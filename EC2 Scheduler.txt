
AWS Instance Scheduler
======================
# AWS Instance Scheduler leverages AWS resource tags and AWS Lambda to automatically stop and restart EC2 and RDS instances.
# The schedule with configuration (such as time zone, time interval, etc.) is stored inside an Amazon DynamoDB table.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. Move to CloudFormation console

2. Create stack
# select â€œAmazon S3 URLâ€ and specify the URL below:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/solutions-reference/aws-instance-scheduler/latest/instance-scheduler.template
# Set Stack name & parameters
# Wait for the CloudFormation stack creation

3.  configure your new AWS instance schedule
 3.1. In AWS Console move to DynamoDB console
 3.2. Find a table with the name of the "stack-configtable" & select it
 3.3. Click on "Explore table items", next to Actions button
     # Scroll down & choose "uk-office-hours", duplicate the item from actions
     # Give name as "my-office-hours" & change timeze as "Asia/Kolkata"
 3.4. Go to Ec2 console, Choose Actions, Instance settings, Manage tags
     # Create tag with key "Schedule" & value as "my-office-hours"

4. Delete the stack after practise
